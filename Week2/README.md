# Open Frameworks animation

I made animations of different shapes using Open Frameworks.
I might further develop them to react on music. 
It will be even better if the sound react shapes are in 3D!

The version of the OpenFrameworks that I used is: of_v0.11.2_vs2017_release



1. Cross loop

2. Noise

These are two kinds of noise animations. One is wireframed, the other one is meshed.
