Welcome to my final project of the Coding Two: Advanced Frameworks.</br></br>
My project was making a sound reacting shapes using Open Frameworks.</br>
I used ofxSceneManager Open Frameworks add-on from this link: https://github.com/Iwanaka/ofxSceneManager</br>
ofxSceneManager uses ofxEasing, so I downloaded it from here:https://github.com/arturoc/ofxEasing</br>
OpenFrameworks version that I used is: of_v0.11.2_vs2017_release.</br></br>

To run the project, you need to turn on your computer microphone.
