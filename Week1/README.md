# Calculation Game


This is a simple game I designed that prints a sequence of 10 values using a function. 
I created a new .cpp file and header (.hpp) and used this to make a new class of object.

The program generates 2 different random numbers from 1 to 100.
Player needs to calculate the sum of them and type it into the screen.
When the player enters the answer correctly, the screen will say "Correct!", when the answer is wrong, "Wrong! Try again."
The program will generate infinite questions.
